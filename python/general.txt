- use f strings for inserting things into strings
  - ex: f'we are printing the number zero: {0}'

- when dealing with dictionaries, use .get(key, default_value) instead of the
  square brackets when parsing through things
  - the default value is for if the key does not exist and it will return that
    value
    - WHEN DEFINING THE default_value (it is None when you do not set it), only
      make it either [] or {} when you have to go INTO the data that you are
      getting
  - use the square brackets on dictionaries that you wrote
  - use .get on dictionaries that you did not write or from api's

- for creating a new branch on git (and changing branches)
  - git checkout -b <branch_name>
  - git checkout <branch_name>

- for seeing all branches
  - git branch -a
