- use f strings for inserting things into strings
  - ex: f'we are printing the number zero: {0}'

- when dealing with dictionaries, use .get(key, default_value) instead of the
  square brackets when parsing through things
  - the default value is for if the key does not exist and it will return that
    value
    - WHEN DEFINING THE default_value (it is None when you do not set it), only
      make it either [] or {} when you have to go INTO the data that you are
      getting
  - use the square brackets on dictionaries that you wrote
  - use .get on dictionaries that you did not write or from api's

- reducing any chance for collisions in the similarities between generated
  strings is very important
  - ex: movie_info = get_movie_info(content_id)
        movie_id = f"movie_{movie_info['id']}"
        format_id = f"format_{movie_id}"
    - movie_id and format_id will not collide because format_id is built on
      the movie_id instead of just being built off of the id as well
